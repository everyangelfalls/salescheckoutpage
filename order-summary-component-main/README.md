### What I learned



Reflecting on what i learned from this project, it has really helped me finally put what i have been learning together. 
Flexbox was something i had a little trouble with but doing this project helped me to finally grap the context. Bringing it altogether and I will continue doing projects similar to this to get better and write more efficient and readable code.
